    "The idea of bagging (or *bootstrap aggregating*) is to make any algorithm more robust. What if we create different models using random subsets, not correlated at all (built with different insights/relationships in the data), and let them give predictions for the same input. The result will predict the value as the average of the different model predictions (so we have all the insights). This averaging is a technique of *ensembling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we build a lot of deep decision trees, each one working on random picked data from the original set, they will overfit badly (are perfect for its subset, and crappy for the rest). Each tree will have errors, but these errors are random. And what's the average of a bunch of random errors? zero! What is left is the true relationship in the data :) That's Random Forest; a way of bagging trees (predictive but, the most important, poorly correlated trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scikit-Learn each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the training set (63,2% of the original dataset samples will be represented in the input, which will have the same size as that dataset, fulfilling the rest with replicated samples). In addition, when splitting a node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. As a result of this randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.\n",

With the existing information we've shown, we can't tell. However, random forests (bagging algorithms in general) have a very clever trick called *out-of-bag (OOB) error* which can handle this (and more!). In fact its main purpose is helping us with model evaluation when we have a very small dataset for train, and we don't want to use part of it for validation.\n",
